# epRNA: Euclidean parametrization of RNA #

This project depends on:
* Python 3
* TensorFlow 2
* Seaborn
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter and Jupyter Notebook

Most of these dependencies may be installed via `pip`.

### What is this repository for? ###

The Jupyter notebook `epRNA tutorial-v1.ipynb` provides a guide to reproducing figures from our manuscript, 
as well as a production-ready script for predicting a coarse-grained RNA model from solely the nucleotide sequence.
